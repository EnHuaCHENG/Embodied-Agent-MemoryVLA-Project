## 🌟 News

- 🔥 \[2025-8-26\] Our paper [MemoryVLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236) is now on arxiv!

## Overview

MemoryVLA is a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for robotic manipulation inspired by human memory systems. It builds a hippocampal-like perceptual-cognitive memory to capture the temporal dependencies essential for current decision-making, enabling long-horizon, temporally aware action generation.

## TODO

We will release 2 versions of the code by the end of October, based on the OpenVLA codebase (MemoryVLA) and our self-developed Dexbotic codebase (MemoryVLA+), the latter having higher simulation performance.

- [ ] MemoryVLA (OpenVLA codebase) Code Release
- [ ] MemoryVLA (OpenVLA codebase) Model Weights Release
- [ ] MemoryVLA+ (Dexbotic codebase) Code Release
- [ ] MemoryVLA+ (Dexbotic codebase) Model Weights Release
